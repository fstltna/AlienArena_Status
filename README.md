# Alien Arena Server Status Checker (1.0.0)
Allows you to get the status of your Alien Arena server(s) -  Official support sites: [Official Github Repo](https://github.com/fstltna/AlienArena_Status) - [Official Forum](https://alienarena.gameplayer.club/index.php/forum/alien-arena-tools)

---

Run "./aastatus". If you need to change any settings after this, edit "aastatus" and make the desired changes.

I then suggest you add this directory (AlienArena_Status) into your path, so that you can just run "git pull" to upgrade to the latest version aastatus as updates come out.
